//        Steps:-
//        variables -> result
//        1. BaseCase :
//             1.1. If node == nil
//             1.2. node.value < L -> Call same function with node.right
//             1.3. node.value > R -> Call same function with node.left
//        2. If above condition get failed then add node.val into result
